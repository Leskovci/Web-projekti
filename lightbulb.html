<p>Inventors started working on a brilliant idea that would change the way we utilize energy in our homes and offices more than 150 years ago. This idea revolutionized building design, lengthened the normal workday, and sparked the creation of new enterprises. It also resulted in new energy innovations, ranging from power plants and transmission lines to household products and electric motors.</p>
    
<p>The light bulb, like many great innovations, cannot be attributed to a single person. The light bulbs we use in our homes today are the result of a series of incremental refinements on previous inventors' ideas.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>INCANDESCENT BULBS LIGHT THE WAY</h2></div>
    
    <div class="img-hover-zoom"><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/11/17/15-light-bulb-rex.jpg?width=982&height=726&auto=webp&quality=75" height="350" class="center"></div>
    
    <p>Long before Thomas Edison patented and began commercializing his incandescent light bulb in 1879 and 1880, British inventors were showing the feasibility of electric light with the arc lamp. The first constant electric light was demonstrated in 1835, and scientists all over the world experimented with the filament (the part of the bulb that produces light when heated by an electrical current) and the bulb's atmosphere for the next 40 years (whether air is vacuumed out of the bulb or it is filled with an inert gas to prevent the filament from oxidizing and burning out). These early bulbs had extremely limited lifespans, were prohibitively expensive to manufacture, and consumed excessive amounts of energy.</p>
    
    <p>When Edison and his Menlo Park researchers initially entered the lighting industry, they focused on refining the filament, first testing carbon, then platinum, and then back to carbon. Edison's team had developed a light bulb using a carbonized filament of uncoated cotton thread that could last 14.5 hours by October 1879. They experimented with filaments until they found one made of bamboo that lasted up to 1,200 hours in Edison's lamps. This filament became the standard for the Edison bulb for the following ten years. Edison also made additional improvements to the light bulb, such as constructing a better vacuum pump to remove all of the air from the bulb and the Edison screw (what is now known as the Edison screw).</p>
    
    <div class="float-img"><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/4/2016/07/GettyImages-5383490532-33078cd.jpg?webp=true&quality=90&crop=4px%2C18px%2C931px%2C401px&resize=931%2C395" height="420" width="1000"></div>
    
    <p>What makes Edison's contribution to electric lighting so remarkable is that he didn't just improve the bulb; he created an entire suite of technologies that made the usage of light bulbs possible. Edison's lighting system was based on the existing gas lighting system. He demonstrated that electricity could be delivered from a centrally positioned generator through a system of wires and tubes with the Holborn Viaduct in London in 1882. (also called conduits). Simultaneously, he focused on increasing energy generation, establishing the Pearl Street Station in lower Manhattan as the first commercial power utility. Edison also invented the first electric meter to keep track of how much electricity each client used.</p>
    
    <p>While Edison worked on the entire lighting system, other innovators continued to make small improvements, such as improving the filament manufacturing process and the bulb's efficiency. The discovery of the tungsten filament by European inventors in 1904 was the next major advancement in the incandescent lamp. In comparison to carbon filament lights, these new tungsten filament bulbs lasted longer and produced a brighter light. Irving Langmuir discovered in 1913 that filling the bulb with an inert gas like nitrogen quadrupled its effectiveness.Over the next 40 years, scientists proceeded to enhance the incandescent bulb, lowering its cost and increasing its efficiency. However, by the 1950s, researchers had only figured out how to convert only 10% of the energy needed by an incandescent bulb into light, so they turned their attention to other lighting options.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>ENERGY SHORTAGES LEAD TO FLUORESCENT BREAKTHROUGHS</h2></div>
    
    <p>In the nineteenth century, two Germans, glassblower Heinrich Geissler and physician Julius Plücker, discovered that by eliminating almost all of the air from a long glass tube and running an electrical current through it, they could produce light, an invention known as the Geissler tube. These lights, which are a sort of discharge lamp, didn't become popular until the early twentieth century, when researchers were seeking for a means to enhance lighting efficiency. Many lighting technologies, such as neon lights, low-pressure sodium lamps (the sort used in outdoor illumination such as streetlamps), and fluorescent lights, are based on discharge lamps.</p>
    
    <p>In the 1890s, both Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla experimented with fluorescent lamps, but neither commercialized them. Instead, one of the predecessors to the fluorescent light was Peter Cooper Hewitt's innovation in the early 1900s. By running an electric current through mercury vapor and integrating a ballast, Hewitt developed a blue-green light (a device connected to the light bulb that regulates the flow of current through the tube). While the Cooper Hewitt lamps were more efficient than incandescent bulbs, the color of the light limited their applications.</p>
    
    <p>European researchers began experimenting with neon tubes coated with phosphors in the late 1920s and early 1930s (a material that absorbs ultraviolet light and converts the invisible light into useful white light). These findings inspired research into fluorescent lamps in the United States, and by the mid to late 1930s, American lighting businesses were exhibiting fluorescent lights to the United States Navy and at the 1939 New York World's Fair. These lights were three times more efficient than incandescent bulbs and lasted longer. Because of the necessity for energy-efficient lighting in American war industry, fluorescents were quickly adopted, and by 1951, linear fluorescent lamps were producing more light in the United States.</p>
    
    <div class="img-hover-zoom"><img src="https://www.thespruce.com/thmb/6S_c4T1l9BaZLFDMarRGBYAngdw=/2032x1143/smart/filters:no_upscale()/FluorescentLightBulb-GettyImages-sb10068290h-001-58fa5bb95f9b581d59119216.jpg" height="350" class="center"></div>
    
    <p>Another energy scarcity, the 1973 oil crisis, prompted lighting engineers to create a fluorescent bulb that could be utilized in domestic settings. Sylvania researchers began looking into how they could miniaturize the ballast and tuck it inside the bulb in 1974. While they were able to obtain a patent for their bulb, they were unable to commercialize it. Edward Hammer of General Electric figured out how to bend the fluorescent tube into a spiral shape two years later, in 1976, resulting in the first compact fluorescent light (CFL). General Electric, like Sylvania, abandoned this concept because the new gear required to mass-produce these lights was prohibitively expensive.</p>
    
    <p>CFLs first on the market in the mid-1980s, with retail prices ranging from $25 to $35, however prices varied widely by region due to various utility promotions. The high cost of CFLs was cited as the most significant barrier to purchase by consumers. Other issues included the fact that many 1990 CFLs were large and unwieldy, didn't fit well in fixtures, and had low light output and variable performance. CFL performance, pricing, efficiency (they use about 75% less energy than incandescents), and durability (they last about 10 times longer) have all improved during the 1990s, making them a viable option for both renters and homeowners. CFLs have been on the market for nearly 30 years, and an ENERGY STAR® CFL costs about the same as a traditional light bulb.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>LEDS: THE FUTURE IS HERE</h2></div>
    
    <p>The light-emitting diode is one of the most rapidly evolving lighting technologies today (or LED). LEDs are a type of solid-state lighting that turn electricity into light using a semiconductor. They are often small in size (less than 1 square millimeter) and emit light in a precise direction, reducing the need for reflectors and diffusers that trap light.</p>
    
    <p>They are also the most energy-efficient lights available. The efficiency of a light bulb, also known as luminous efficacy, is the ratio of emitted light (lumens) to the electricity it consumes (watts). The efficacy of a bulb that converts energy into light at 100 percent efficiency is 683 lm/W. To put this in perspective, a 60- to 100-watt incandescent bulb has a 15-lm/W efficacy, an equivalent CFL has a 73-lm/W efficacy, and modern LED-based replacement bulbs on the market have efficacy ratings ranging from 70-120 lm/W with an average efficacy of 85 lm/W.</p>
