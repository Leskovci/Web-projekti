<p>Computers have been around for almost 200 years. Initially conceptualized by mathematicians and entrepreneurs, mechanical calculating machines were conceived and manufactured during the nineteenth century to handle more complicated number-crunching issues. By the early twentieth century, technological advancements had permitted ever more complicated computers, and computers had grown in size and capability.</p>
    
    <p>Computers nowadays are essentially unrecognizable from designs from the nineteenth century, such as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine — or even from the massive computers of the twentieth century, such as the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator, which took up entire rooms.</p>
    
    <p>Here's a quick rundown of computer history, from their earliest number-crunching origins to today's sophisticated devices that surf the web, play games, and stream multimedia.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>19th Century</h2></div>
    
    <p>1801: A French merchant and inventor named Joseph Marie Jacquard invents a loom that weaves fabric designs automatically using punched wooden cards. Punch cards were used in early computers in a similar way.</p>
    
    <p>1821:Charles Babbage, an English mathematician, devises a steam-powered calculating engine that can compute tables of numbers. According to the University of Minnesota, the project, dubbed the "Difference Engine," was funded by the British government but failed due to a lack of technology at the time.</p>
    
    <p>1848: The world's first computer program is written by Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician and the daughter of poet Lord Byron. Lovelace produces the first program while translating a paper on Babbage's Analytical Engine from French to English, according to Anna Siffert, a professor of theoretical mathematics at the University of Münster in Germany. "She also adds her own observations to the text. Her notes, which she simply refers to as "notes," end up being three times as long as the actual transcript "In an article for The Max Planck Society, Siffert writes. "Lovelace also offers a step-by-step description for computing Bernoulli numbers with Babbage's machine — essentially an algorithm — therefore making her the first computer programmer in the world." Bernoulli numbers are a set of rational numbers that are frequently utilized in mathematics.</p>
    
    <p>1853: The world's first printing calculator is created by Swedish inventor Per Georg Scheutz and his son Edvard. According to Uta C. Merzbach's book, "Georg Scheutz and the First Printing Calculator," the machine is important for being the first to "calculate tabular differences and print the findings" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1977).</p>
    
    <p>1890: To aid in the calculation of the 1890 U.S. Census, Herman Hollerith devises a punch-card method. According to Columbia University, the machine saves the government many years of calculations and the US taxpayer almost $5 million. Hollerith later founds a firm that would ultimately become known as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Early 20th Century</h2></div>
    
    <p>1931: According to Stanford University, Vannevar Bush invents and builds the Differential Analyzer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is the first large-scale automatic general-purpose mechanical analog computer. </p>
    
    <p>1936: According to Chris Bernhardt's book "Turing's Vision," Alan Turing, a British scientist and mathematician, proposes the notion of a universal machine, subsequently known as the Turing machine, in a paper titled "On Computable Numbers.." (The MIT Press, 2017). Turing machines can calculate anything that can be computed. His concepts are at the heart of the current computer's design. According to the National Museum of Computing in the United Kingdom, Turing was later involved in the construction of the Turing-Welchman Bombe, an electro-mechanical device designed to decrypt Nazi codes during World War II. </p>

    <p>1937: Professor of physics and mathematics John Vincent Atanasoff of Iowa State University submits a grant proposal to develop the world's first electric-only computer, without the use of gears, cams, belts, or shafts.</p>
    
    <p>1939: The Hewlett Packard Company was founded in Palo Alto, California, by David Packard and Bill Hewlett. According to MIT, the two settle on the name of their new firm by tossing a coin, and Hewlett-first Packard's headquarters are in Packard's garage. </p>
    
    <p>1941: According to Gerard O'Regan's book "A Brief History of Computing," German inventor and engineer Konrad Zeuse completes his Z3 machine, the world's first digital computer (Springer, 2021). During World War II, a bombing raid on Berlin destroyed the machine. According to O'Regan, Zeuse escaped the German capital when Nazi Germany was defeated and later created the world's first commercial digital computer, the Z4, in 1950. The Atanasoff-Berry Computer, designed by Atanasoff and his graduate student Clifford Berry, is the first digital electronic computer in the United States (ABC). According to the book "Birthing the Computer," this is the first time a computer can store information in its main memory and can complete one operation every 15 seconds (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016). </p>
    
    <p>1945: The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator is designed and built by two University of Pennsylvania academics, John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert (ENIAC). According to Edwin D. Reilly's book "Milestones in Computer Science and Information Technology," the machine was the first "automated, general-purpose, electronic, decimal, digital computer" (Greenwood Press, 2003). </p>
    
    <div class="img-hover-zoom"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/informationq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/First-electronic-digital-programmable-computer.jpg?w=648&ssl=1" height="300" class="center"></div>
    
    <p>1946: Mauchly and Presper depart the University of Pennsylvania to construct the UNIVAC, the first commercial computer for corporate and government applications, with support from the Census Bureau.</p>
    
    <p>1947: The transistor is invented by Bell Laboratories' William Shockley, John Bardeen, and Walter Brattain. They figure out how to manufacture an electric switch out of solid materials without a vacuum.</p>
    
    <p>1949: According to O'Regan, a team at the University of Cambridge creates the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC), which is "the first practical stored-program computer." "In May 1949, EDSAC ran its first program, which calculated a table of squares and a list of prime numbers," wrote O'Regan. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer was built by scientists from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), now known as CSIRO, in November 1949. (CSIRAC). According to O'Regan, CSIRAC is the world's first digital computer capable of playing music.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Late 20th Centrury</h2></div>
    
    <p>1953: According to the National Museum of American History, Grace Hopper created the first computer language, which became known as COBOL, which stood for COmmon, Business-Oriented Language. In her posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom citation, Hopper is dubbed the "First Lady of Software." The IBM 701 EDPM is created by Thomas Johnson Watson Jr., son of IBM CEO Thomas Johnson Watson Sr., to assist the United Nations in keeping track of Korea during the war.</p>
    
    <p>1954: According to MIT, IBM programmers John Backus and his team write a paper outlining their newly discovered FORTRAN programming language. FORTRAN stands for FORmula TRANslation.</p>
    
    <p>1958: The integrated circuit, sometimes known as a computer chip, is unveiled by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce. Kilby's work is later recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics.</p>
    
    <p>1968: At the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, Douglas Engelbart unveils a prototype of the modern computer. According to the Doug Engelbart Institute, his presentation, titled "A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect," features a live demonstration of his computer, which includes a mouse and a graphical user interface (GUI). This is the turning point in the computer's evolution from a specialist machine for academics to a technology that is more widely available.</p>
    
    <p>1969: According to Bell Labs, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and a group of other developers created UNIX, an operating system that enabled "large-scale networking of heterogeneous computing systems — and the internet." UNIX's creators continued to work on the operating system using the C programming language, which they also improved. </p>
