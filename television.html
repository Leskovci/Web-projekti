    <div class="ok"><h2>Experiments</h2></div>
    
<p>On September 7, 1927, the first successful demonstration of electronic television took place in San Francisco. Philo Taylor Farnsworth, a 21-year-old inventor who had lived in a house without electricity since he was 14, invented the system. Farnsworth had begun to imagine a system that could record moving images in a form that could be coded onto radio waves and then turned back into a picture on a screen while still in high school. Boris Rosing had undertaken some rudimentary image transmission tests in Russia 16 years before Farnsworth's first breakthrough.Also in the 1920s, John Logie Baird in England and Charles Francis Jenkins in the United States presented a mechanical television system that scanned images using a revolving disk with holes arranged in a spiral pattern. Farnsworth's invention, which used an electron beam to scan images, is the direct forerunner of contemporary television. It was a simple line that he conveyed as his first image. "When are we going to see some dollars in this thing, Farnsworth?" an investor had asked, prompting him to point his crude camera at a dollar symbol.</p>

    <h2>Early Development</h2>
    
    <p>RCA, with its two NBC networks, dominated the radio market in the United States, investing $50 million in the creation of electronic television. The company's president, David Sarnoff, hired Vladimir Kosma Zworykin, a Russian-born physicist who had participated in Rosing's studies, to lead the initiative. The inauguration of the New York World's Fair was aired by RCA in 1939, and included a speech by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the first president to appear on television. RCA paid for a license to use Farnsworth's television patents later that year. RCA began offering television sets with picture tubes measuring 5 by 12 inches (12.7 by 25.4 cm). On May 17, 1939, the business began airing regular programming, featuring scenes filmed by a mobile unit.</p>
    
    <p>Early television was rudimentary at best. All of the action at that first televised baseball game had to be captured by a single camera, and early cameras obliged actors in dramas to labor under impossiblely bright lighting, wearing black lipstick and green makeup (the cameras had trouble with the color white). Early CBS newscasts were "chalk talks," in which a newscaster moved a pointer across a map of Europe, which was then devoured by war. It was difficult to make out the newsman, let alone the map, due to the poor clarity of the image. The development of television was hampered during World War II, as businesses such as RCA focused on military production.The dispute over wavelength allocations with the new FM radio, as well as a battle over government control, hindered television's rise even more. The Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) determination in 1941 that the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) had to sell one of its two radio networks. The new American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which would enter television early in the next decade, became the second network. During the war, six experimental television stations remained on the air: one each in Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Schenectady, New York, as well as two in New York City. In the United States, however, full-scale commercial television broadcasting did not commence until 1947.</p>
    
    <h2>The Beginning Of Commercial Television</h2>
    
    <p>Americans could watch The Texaco Star Theater (1948), featuring Milton Berle, or the children's show Howdy Doody (1947–60) in 1949 if they were within range of the country's rising number of television stations. They also had the option of watching one of two 15-minute newscasts: CBS TV News (1948) with Douglas Edwards or NBC's Camel News Caravan (1948) with John Cameron Swayze (who was required by the tobacco company sponsor to have a burning cigarette always visible when he was on camera). Many early shows, such as Amos 'n' Andy (1951) or The Jack Benny Show (1950–65), were based on the older, more established Big Brother of early television: network radio.The majority of the new series' forms, such as newscasts, situation comedies, variety shows, and dramas, were also copied from radio (see radio broadcasting and television programming). NBC and CBS used their radio income to support the creation of this new media. Television networks, on the other hand, would soon be producing large profits of their own, while network radio would all but vanish, but for the delivery of hourly newscasts. Ideas for what to do with the visual element that television brought to radio seemed to be in short supply at times. The temptation for news broadcasts, in particular, was to cover the screen with "talking heads," newscasters just reading the news, as they would on radio. The networks initially relied on newsreel companies for images of breaking news events.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>McCarthyism</h2></div>

    <p>In 1947, the House Committee on Un-American Activities launched an investigation into the film business, and Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy quickly began railing against what he thought was government Communist infiltration. The increasing national witch-hunt had an impact on broadcasting as well. "Counterattack: The Newsletter of Facts on Communism," issued by three former FBI agents, and "Red Channels," a leaflet released in 1950, highlighted the alleged Communist ties of 151 performing artists. Advertisers, the source of network earnings, were targeted by anti-Communist vigilantes. Political convictions were suddenly used as a reason for dismissal. The majority of the producers, writers, and actors accused of having left-wing leanings were blacklisted and unable to find work. CBS even created a loyalty oath for its employees.Edward R. Murrow, a brilliant former radio reporter, was one of the few people in television who was well-positioned and gutsy enough to speak out against McCarthyism. Murrow launched See It Now, a television documentary series, in 1950 with news producer Fred Friendly. Murrow narrated a report on McCarthy on March 9, 1954, revealing the senator's faulty tactics. "His mistake has been to associate dissent with treason," Murrow said of McCarthy. CBS, which was nervous, declined to promote Murrow and Friendly's show.McCarthy responded on April 6 when CBS offered him free time, labeling Murrow "the leader and the smartest of the jackal pack that is always found at the throat of anyone who seeks to expose Communist traitors." McCarthy proved to be his own worst enemy in this TV appearance, and it became clear that Murrow had assisted in breaking McCarthy's reign of terror. McCarthy was censured by the US Senate in 1954, and CBS's "security" office was shut down.</p>

    <p>Between 1953 and 1955, television programming began to diverge from radio formats in some ways. The "spectacular" was created by NBC television president Sylvester Weaver, with Peter Pan (1955), starring Mary Martin, attracting 60 million people. Weaver also created the magazine-format shows Today, which debuted in 1952 and was hosted by Dave Garroway until 1961, and The Tonight Show, which debuted in 1953 and was anchored by Steve Allen (until 1957). With youth-oriented series like Disneyland (which began in 1954 and has since been shown under many names) and The Mickey Mouse Club (1955–59; see Disney, Walt), the third network, ABC, made its first profit.</p>

Since its premiere in 1951, I Love Lucy, the highly successful situation comedy starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, had been filmed (lasting until 1957). It was widely imitated. The Honeymooners, featuring Jackie Gleason, was televised for the first time in 1955, also on film (lasting until 1956 with the original cast).Viewers seemed to prefer dramas or comedies, which, if less intellectual, at least provided a regular cast of people week after week.

    <h2>The Rise Of Cable</h2>
    
    <p>Cable TV began quietly in a few geographically isolated towns, challenging the dominance of the three major television networks and offering Americans the choice of dozens, if not hundreds, of television channels. Everyone linked had the opportunity to get all of the channels available in the neighboring city thanks to large antennas built in high places. By 1960, there were roughly 640 CATV (community antenna television) systems in the United States. However, it soon became clear that "television deprived" consumers were not the only ones who wanted access to more channels and programs. Cable companies in New York City agreed to broadcast the home games of the city's basketball and hockey clubs.In New York, cable had more than 80,000 subscribers by 1971. Then, in 1975, Time Inc.'s Home Box Office (HBO) debuted; Ted Turner's "superstation," later called WTBS, debuted in 1976; and, in 1979, C-SPAN (live broadcasts of the House of Representatives), ESPN (sports), and Nickelodeon (children's programming) debuted. The next year, Turner launched the Cable News Network (CNN).</p>
    
    <h2>International Growth</h2>

    <p>In other countries, the evolution of television followed various paths. Some, most, or all of the main networks were frequently owned by the government rather than private enterprises. The British Broadcasting Corporation, the country's primary radio broadcaster, developed and maintained television dominance in the United Kingdom. The BBC gained a worldwide reputation for delivering high-quality programs, thanks to a tax on the sale of television sets. Some commentators complimented the seriousness of much of the news and public-affairs programs produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which was also liberated from many commercial constraints thanks to government sponsorship.The government also backed France's major television networks; but, in France, this assistance was perceived as fostering a bias in news coverage in favor of whichever party was in power at the time. The hold of these government-funded networks began to wane in the late 1980s and 1990s, as cable and direct-satellite television systems boosted the number of channels available. The majority of countries began to adopt the American model of privately owned, advertiser-supported television networks.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>New Technologies</h2></div>
    
    <p>Home videocassette recorders became widely available in the 1980s. Viewers got the ability to record and repeat shows, as well as rent and watch movies at their leisure in the comfort of their own homes. During this decade, video games grew increasingly popular, especially among the young, and the television, which had previously served just as a source of passive entertainment, evolved into an elaborate, moving, computerized gaming board. During the 1980s, the number of cable networks rose steadily, then burst in the 1990s as improved cable technology and direct-broadcast satellite television expanded the number of channels available to viewers. With the popularity of the Fox network and the subsequent entrance of the UPN and WB networks, the number of broadcast networks increased as well.The broadcast networks' audience share continued to dwindle, falling from well over 90% in the early 1980s to less than 50% by 1997. Despite the fact that the US population has grown, Nielson Media Research estimates that fewer people watched the widely publicized final episode of Seinfeld in 1998 (originally aired in 1990; see Seinfeld, Jerry) than saw the final episode of MASH in 1983. (first aired in 1972).The acquittal of former football star O. J. Simpson in 1994 for the murder of his wife proved the power of cable networks over American audiences. Some stations broadcasted practically every minute of the marathon trial live, followed by conversation shows delving into the day's events. Children's television has long been a topic of discussion among social scientists, parents, and politicians (see children's television).With increased competition brought on by the growth of cable networks in the late 1980s and 1990s, talk programs and "tabloid" news shows looked to extend further open or sensational on-air sex conversation.</p>
    
    <p>In 1996, the television industry decided to disclose ratings of its programs in response to government pressure. The ratings were created to identify which age groups the programs would be appropriate for: TV-G (for general audiences), TV-PG (parental guidance recommended), TV-14 (unsuitable for children under 14), and TV-MA (not suitable for children under 14). (for mature audiences only). Following more complaints, all networks except NBC agreed to add V (for violence), S (for sex), L (for coarse language), and D (for suggestive dialogue) to those ratings the following year.Also, in accordance with a clause of a telecommunications bill passed in 1996, the "V-chip" embedded in new television sets provided parents the power to automatically prevent their children from watching television shows with unacceptable ratings. Critics viewed the ratings as a step toward censorship, questioning whether a TV-14 rating would make a program appear more, rather than less, appealing to a curious child. In 1997, the federal government allocated an additional channel to each U.S. television broadcaster for the introduction of high definition television, or HDTV. In 1998, the first broadcasts of this high-resolution television format, in which visuals appear significantly sharper and clearer, began.Standard television sets will be unable to receive HDTV and will presumably need to be updated or upgraded by 2006, when traditional, low-definition television broadcasts will cease and broadcasters will return their non-HDTV channel to the government. The HDTV format, which was adopted in the United States, demands for digital transmission of television signals. This will allow computers, the Internet, and television to become ever more integrated.</p>

    <p>In 1998, video could be viewed on the World Wide Web, and television programs could be viewed and searched on a computer. As computers become more powerful, video should be as simple to handle as text. The television schedule may ultimately be replaced by a system that allows viewers to watch programs or portions of programs that have been digitally recorded and distributed whenever they wish. In most other nations, such technological advances, such as the proliferation of new cable networks, have been slower than in the United States.According to one poll, it wasn't until the 1990s that the widespread availability of television transmitters, television sets, and electricity enabled half of the world's population to watch television. Television, on the other hand, has a great global appeal. According to one estimate, people who own a television set watch it for an average of two and a half hours every day.</p>
