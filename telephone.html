<p>In the years 1876â€“1877, a new innovation known as the telephone was born. It's not easy to figure out who invented anything. On February 14, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray filed separate patent applications for telephones with the US Patent Office in Washington. Bell was in Boston at the time and had no knowledge the application had been submitted because he was represented by his lawyers. Gray's application arrived at the patent office a few hours before Bell's, but Bell's lawyers insisted on paying the application fee right away, thus Bell's application was registered first by the overburdened office.</p>

<p>On March 7, Bell's patent was authorized and officially registered, and three days later, Bell's summons to his helper ("Mr Watson, come hither.") was believed to have been made. I'd like to see you.") validated the success of the invention.</p>
    
<p>Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, one year before Lars Magnus Ericsson. Bell's interest in telephony stemmed from his deaf mother and his father, Alexander Melville Bell, an elocution teacher best known for developing the phonetic transcription technique that helped the deaf learn to talk (and which he described in a book entitled Visible Speech). In 1870, the Bell family immigrated to Canada; two years later, Alexander Melville Bell was given a teaching position at a deaf school in Boston, Massachusetts, but he instead suggested his son for the position. At the time, father and son were collaborating to see if sound might be made visible for the first time.</p>

<p>Many others, on the other hand, had been working on the idea of telephony for years. Bell had allegedly obtained and used an instrument, the "teletrophono," built by Antonio Meucci long before Bell and Gray, according to a resolution passed by the US House of Representatives in June 2002.</p>
    
<p>One piece of evidence against Bell was that Meucci's material had vanished without a trace from the facility where Bell was doing his tests. The American government launched procedures in the 1880s, accusing Bell of "fraudulent and dishonest conduct" and claiming that his patent should be cancelled. Following Meucci's death in 1889 and the expiration of Bell's patent in 1893, these proceedings were halted.</p>
    
<p>Bell's attorneys allegedly obtained technical data from Gray's attorneys (both had lawyers serving as their agents) that were allegedly added to Bell's application after it had been submitted, according to a later study published by A. Edward Evenson in 2000. The entire narrative has elements that are similar to a thriller.</p>
    
<p>One notable point is that Bell did not believe it was necessary to get telephone patents in the Nordic nations. This meant that anyone could make and sell telephones from anywhere in the world.</p>
    
<p>In June 1876, Bell debuted the telephone in front of a large audience at the World Exhibition in Philadelphia. The physicist William Thomson (later known as Lord Kelvin) was in the audience, having shown Bell's telephone to the British Association in Glasgow in August of that year. Dagens Nyheter became the first newspaper in Sweden to allude to "the speaking telegraph," an instrument that "plainly and clearly transferred the words pronounced at one end of the telegraph line to the other" on September 30 of that year.</p>
    
<p>As reported in the patent application, the original iteration of Bell's telephone proved unsuitable for practical use. A telephone could only be built for mass production after "a rather complete reconstruction," as Hemming Johansson put it. On July 11, 1877, the Bell Telephone Company was established. The first usable Bell telephone arrived in Europe in the same month, and was handed to the British Association in Plymouth by the General Post Office's chief engineer, William H. Preece, in the presence of Bell himself.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Important Dates</h2></div>
    
    <p>1878 - Instead of having direct lines, the workable exchange was created, allowing calls to be exchanged between customers.</p>
        
    <p>1879 - Subscribers were no longer identified by their names but by numbers.</p>
    
    <p>1880's - During this time, metallic circuits were used to expand long-distance service.</p>
    
    <p>1888 -Instead of relying on each unit's own battery, Hammond V. Hayes created a common battery system that allows one central battery to power all telephones on an exchange.</p>
    
    <p>1891 - A Kansas City undertaker devised the first automatic dialing device. He believed that shady operators were steering his potential clients away from him. His goal was to eliminate the operators completely.</p>

    <p>1900 - In Hartford, Connecticut, the first coin-operated telephone was installed.</p>
    
    <p>1904 - The Bell Company created the "French Phone." The transmitter and receiver were housed in a single handset.</p>
    
    <p>1911 - In a hostile acquisition, American Telephone and Telegraph (AT & T) acquires the Western Union Telegraph Company. They made secret stock purchases in the company, and the two finally amalgamated.</p>
    
    <p>1918 - It was believed that 10 million Bell system telephones were in use across the United States.</p>
    
    <p>1921 - The usage of phantom circuits allowed for the switching of enormous numbers of calls. Three conversations might be carried out on two pairs of wires as a result of this.</p>
    
    <p>1927 - The first transatlantic service between New York and London was launched. Radio waves were used to transmit the signal.</p>

    <p>1936 - The electronic switching system was developed in the 1960s as a result of research into electronic telephone exchanges (SES).</p>
    
    <p>1946 - The world's first commercial mobile phone service is launched. It could use radio waves to connect moving automobiles to a telephone network.</p>
    
    <p>1947 - Microwave radio technology used for the first time for long distance phone calls.</p>
    
    <p>1947 - The transistor was invented at Bell laboratories.</p>
    
    <p>1955 - Saw the beginning of the laying of transatlantic telephone cables.</p>

    <p>1962 - Telstar was launched as the world's first international communications satellite.</p>
    
    <p>1980's - During this decade, the invention of fiber optic cables opened up the possibility of carrying far bigger volumes of calls than satellite or microwaves.</p>
    
    <p>1980's, 1990's, and now - Huge advancements in microelectronic technology have allowed the development of cellular (mobile) phones to progress at an incredible rate during the last two decades. When a cellular (mobile) phone enters and exits a cell, it has its own central transmitter, which allows it to receive seamless transmissions.</p>
