<p>Have you ever utilized a smartphone app to get directions to a new restaurant or to get around traffic on your way to work? Have you ever hailed a ridesharing service using one? How about logging some miles on a short run? These modern necessities and luxuries, from things as simple as telling time on your phone or computer to things as complex as self-driving automobiles, are all supported by something most people take for granted: the Global Positioning System (GPS).</p>
    
    <p>GPS technologies have grown so deeply ingrained into people's daily lives that it's difficult to picture a world without them, but they originated from humble beginnings. The Aerospace Corporation, in fact, was a key contributor to the development of the concept and technology, and it continues to support these important systems today.</p>
    
    <p>Here's a quick rundown of how space-based navigation became such an important part of our daily lives.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>A Child Of The Space Race</h2></div>
    
    <p>Sputnik, the first satellite to orbit the Earth, was launched by Russia in 1957. The spacecraft Sputnik sent out a radio signal while it orbited the planet. A group of scientists at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) noticed an odd phenomenon: the frequency of radio signals transmitted by Sputnik increased as the satellite neared, then decreased as it moved away.</p>
    
    <p>The Doppler Effect is a term used in physics to describe this change. The Doppler Effect of the Sputnik satellite allowed scientists to track the satellite's velocity from the ground using radio transmissions. They later developed the concept: if a satellite's location could be known from the ground based on the frequency shift of its radio transmission, then a ground receiver's location could be calculated based on its distance from a satellite.</p>
    
    <p>This approach was used by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to construct Transit, the world's first global satellite navigation system, in 1958. The first Transit satellite was launched in 1960, and the concept was developed by John Hopkins University APL to provide navigation to military and commercial users, including the Navy's missile submarines. In the mid-1960s, the program was handed over to the Navy, and by 1968, a constellation of 36 satellites was completely operational. Transit's technology is credited with "raising the accuracy of the maps of Earth's land areas by approximately two orders of magnitude," which has aided in increasing adoption of satellite navigation.</p>
    
    <p>Transit was in use for 28 years until 1996, when it was replaced by the current Global Positioning System by the Defense Department (GPS).</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Advancing GPS Innovation</h2></div>
    
    <div class="float-img"><img src="https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/styles/large_embed/public/2020-11/Project%20621-B.jpg?itok=QI0McZem" height="300"></div>
    
    <p>The Aerospace Corporation's founding President, Dr. Ivan Getting, envisioned a more powerful and accurate system, which he referred to as "lighthouses in the sky." Aerospace began researching ways to build and improve a satellite navigation system in 1963. The Air Force developed a new satellite navigation program named 621-B after a 1963 Aerospace study conducted by Phillip Diamond advocated a concept called 621-B. With Getting's passion and foresight, the Air Force formed a new satellite navigation program dubbed 621-B. Further system studies, conducted in 1966 by aerospace engineers James Woodford and Hideyoshi Nakamura, advocated an architecture that would eliminate the need for high-accuracy clocks in the receivers by using measurements from four satellites. As a result, prohibitive prices were greatly reduced, increasing the adoption of the technology by making it more economically viable.</p>
    
    <p>According to the concept, each satellite would have its own clock, which would be periodically updated by signal from ground stations, which would monitor the GPS satellites' movements with high precision and accuracy. The choice to shift the clocks from the ground receiver to the satellite later on would have huge implications: without the requirement for a clock on the ground, GPS devices may be downsized to the point where they could fit within a cellphone.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the rest of the 1960s, technological breakthroughs such as solid-state microprocessors, computers, and bandwidth utilization techniques supported the development of GPS. The Naval Research Laboratory's (NRL) Naval Center for Space Technology developed atomic clocks, which contributed to advancements in the Timation satellite-based navigation system (Time Navigation). Crystal oscillator clocks were installed aboard the first two Timation satellites, which were launched in 1967 and 1968. In 1974, a third satellite became the first to be equipped with an atomic clock, substantially improving accuracy and allowing for three-dimensional position coverage.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Forging The Path Forward</h2></div>
    
    <div class="img-hover-zoom"><img src="https://aerospace.org/sites/default/files/styles/large_embed/public/2018-05/Navstar%20backpack.jpg?itok=drDMptQh" class="center"></div>
    
    <p>The satellite navigation program was handed over to Air Force Col. Bradford Parkinson in November 1972. Parkinson oversaw a team that created a proposal that combined the greatest elements of TRANSIT, Timation, and Project 621-B. In December 1973, the Defense Department approved a revised system concept for a 24-satellite passive 1-way ranging system that used atomic clocks in medium Earth orbits to create a 12-hour period.</p>
    
    <p>The first of a series of Navstar satellites, the ground control system, and other types of military user equipment were developed by the US Air Force in 1974.</p>
    
    <p>The first Block I developmental Navstar/GPS satellite was launched in February 1978, followed by three more Navstar satellites before the end of 1978. Between 1977 and 1979, more than 700 tests were undertaken in which Aerospace engineers assisted in confirming the accuracy of the integrated space/control/user system. In the early 1980s, more GPS Block I demonstration satellites were launched.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Importance Of GPS In National Security</h2></div>
    
    <p>In an attempt to improve navigation and safety for air travel, President Ronald Reagan permitted the use of Navstar (or GPS) by civilian commercial airlines in 1983. The first step toward allowed civilian use was the authorisation to provide free access to GPS data to industries other than the US military. By 1989, hand-held GPS units were commercially available, including the Magellan Corporation's Magellan NAV 1000, which weighed 1.5 pounds, had a short battery life, and cost $3,000.</p>
    
    <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, GPS technology improved. The first operational GPS Block II satellite was launched aboard a Delta II rocket in 1989, after a production and development phase that began in 1985.</p>
    
    <p>Concerns emerged among government officials that US adversaries may use the GPS system and its data against the US. As a result, the Defense Department opted to make the technology less precise in non-military applications (a process known as "selective availability") in order to discourage enemy use.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>Proliferation And Wider Adoption of GPS</h2></div>
    
    <div class="img-hover-zoom"><img src="https://insidegnss-com.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IIA.jpeg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1" height="400" class="center"></div>
    
    <p>As GPS coverage grew to full operating capability, so did its reach into the lives of ordinary people. When Benefon debuted the Benefon Esc!, a GPS-equipped phone that would pave the way for more, GPS technology made its debut in a cellphone in 1999. Automobiles began to incorporate GPS technology.</p>
    
    <p>The government approved proposals in 2000 to add three more GPS signals for non-military use. More importantly, the US government discontinued the "selective availability" scheme, which reduced civilian GPS users' accuracy. As a result of this move, civilian GPS signals became ten times more precise overnight.</p>
    
    <p>GPS receivers and processing chips have also fallen in price from around $3000 to $1.50. GPS usage for in-car navigation, location-based services, personal technology, and use in shipping, sailing, and other industries has grown exponentially as accuracy and cost have decreased.</p>
    
    <div class="ok"><h2>The New GPS</h2></div>
    
    <img src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/car-gps-2019-2x1-lowres5593.jpg?auto=webp&quality=75&crop=2:1&width=980&dpr=2" height="450" class="center">
    
    <p>By the year 2000, it was clear that the system needed to be updated to keep up with the fast growing military and civilian uses. A technique was created to add new signals to satellites that had not yet been launched, although satisfying the complete upgraded criteria would necessitate a new program known as GPS III.</p>
    
    <p>By 2005, the Block II satellites came in five different configurations, each with its own set of capabilities: original IIs, IIAs, and IIRs were already in orbit; eight updated IIR-Ms were on their way, and 12 modernized IIFs were in the works. The first upgraded IIF went live in 2010, with the rest following in 2017. </p>
    
    <p>At the same time, the GPS III program started the DoD approval process, which led to the award of satellite contracts in 2008 and ground system contracts in 2010. The first GPS III satellite was launched in 2018 on a SpaceX Falcon 9, followed by the second satellite in 2019 on a ULA Delta IV, and the third and fourth GPS III satellites in 2020 on Falcon 9 rockets. By 2023, the last six satellites will have been launched.</p>
    
    <p>The GPS III Follow-on (GPS IIIF) satellites are currently being developed to complete a full constellation of updated GPS satellites.</p>
    
    <p>Our world continues to be impacted by space-based navigation technology. It's also not only the direct PNT data that makes it so important for maps, weather, and synchronized/crowd-sourced data; it's the integration of that data with other data that makes it so powerful. According to reports, GPS satellites have aided in the generation of approximately $1.4 trillion in economic benefits since the 1980s. Our data networks and financial systems rely on PNT timing to function properly.It is used in the scientific study of earthquakes, volcanoes, and tectonic plate movement. Construction and farming, including the application of water and pesticides, are both aided by space-based navigation. According to a 2019 study, GPS-enabled location-based services like guidance apps helped American consumers save 52 billion gallons of gas and drive nearly one trillion fewer vehicle miles between 2007 and 2017.</p>
